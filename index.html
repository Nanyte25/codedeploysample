codedeploy training 


Name: Basic CodeDeploy Overview

Description:

This instructor led training introduces the CodeDeploy service and how it is used, reviews the architecture as well as the tools used for troubleshooting customer use cases.

Following this training you must also complete the below exercises:

Code Deploy:

    Exercise 1:
        Create three instances.
        Create a github repository to host your application code (be mindful of not storing keys)
        Create an application that ensures that apache is installed before deploying (use a deployment hook)
        Create a deployment group with the instances
        Deploy the github application to the deployment group
    Exercise 2:
        Create an Autoscaling group
        Create a second deployment group in the application created with the security group
        Deploy the application you created in exercise 1
    Bonus exercise:
        For quick testing create one cloudformation templates that:
            Creates three instances
            Creates an application
            Creates a deployment group with the instances
            You can use this template to quickly create resources for case work
        Same thing with an ASG

Duration: 120 minutes 

is best for application configuration only
its a stable platform to deploy to.

Appspecfile.yaml

application
deployment groups
code deploy has no integrated rollback.

requirements for codedeploy to run
IAM roles  awscodedeployrole
service role and the managed Policy  AmazonEc2roleforAWSCodeDeploy grnats permission to agent code running inside your instance.


what can you use to create Deployment Groups?

1.TAG Keys
2.Tag value
3.ASG names

One at a Time
The deployment will:
Deploy to one instance at a time. Succeed if all instances succeed. Fail after the very first failure. Allow the deployment to succeed for some instances, even if the overall deployment fails.
Example:
If you deploy your application to 3 instances, this configuration will deploy to one instance at a time.
Succeeds if all 3 instances succeed.
Fails after any instance fails.
Half at a Time
The deployment will:
Deploy to up to half of the instances at a time, with fractions rounded down. Succeed if at least half of the instances succeed, otherwise it will fail. The deployment may succeed for some instances, even if the overall deployment fails.
Example:
If you deploy your application to 3 instances, this configuration will deploy to one instance at a time.
Succeeds if 2 or more instances succeed.
Fails if 2 or more instances fail.
All at Once
The deployment will:
Deploy to all instances at once. Succeed if at least one instance succeeds. Fail after all instances fail.
Example:
If you deploy your application to 3 instances, this configuration will deploy to all 3 instances at once.
Succeeds if any instance succeeds.
Fails if all instances fail.




always recommend to customer to use the userdata to intstall the codedeploy agent onto an instance
